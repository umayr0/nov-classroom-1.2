# Exercise: In your repo, using Actions set up a workflow which prints "Hello World", prints out the current working directory path and the contents of the current location 
# Stretch goal - Create a command which prints out the name of the job and the commit message

# This is an IDE for creating a workflow with .yaml
# Workflows are processes or commands you want to run when a certain thing happens

# When code is pushed to this repo (on this branch) Print out to the console "Code Pushed"

# Workflows creates a linux instance for us and runs the specified commands 

name: GitActions Demo

# Do these actions when we push to this branch
on: [push]

# What jobs you wish the server to do
jobs:
  # What is the name of the job
  basic_action:
    # What type of instance is this job running on, linux distribution 
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # What are we wanting our ubuntu machine to do
    steps: 
    # echo outputs some text, by default this is to the terminal but can also add text to a file
    - run: echo 'Hello World!'
    - run: echo "${PWD}" # Our runner has inbuilt variables we can access
    - run: ls # Our runner has inbuilt variables we can access
    - run: ls -a # Our runner has inbuilt variables we can access
    - run: echo 'Commit message ${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}'
    - run: echo 'job name ${{ github.job }}'
